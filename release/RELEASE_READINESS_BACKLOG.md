# RELEASE READINESS BACKLOG

| ID | Category | Reference | Severity | Impact | Fix Steps | Acceptance Criteria | Evidence Plan | Feature Change Flag |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RCB-001 | QA | WCAG 2.2 | Low | UX trust | Fix nearby map filter logic to default `showInNearby` to true when unset; preserve user flow by only filtering out users with explicit privacy hidden state. Add regression test for missing `privacySettings`. | A user with `privacySettings` undefined renders nearby list; with explicit hidden false list is empty and no runtime error. | `components/NearbyView.tsx`; `components/NearbyView.test.tsx`; `release/evidence/map_fix/nearbyview-test.txt`; `release/evidence/map_fix/type-check.txt`; `release/evidence/map_fix/build.txt`; `release/evidence/map_fix/nearby-page-smoke-preview.txt`; `release/evidence/map_fix/nearby-page-smoke.png` | No |
| RCB-002 | Security | MASVS-7, MASTG-ARCH | Low | data risk | Add strict null/NaN checks for distance and last-active timestamps; avoid unstable filter behavior and implicit false assumptions. | No crash path for malformed profile fields; stable nearby ordering with safe distance values. | `components/NearbyView.tsx`; new regression test. | No |
| RCB-003 | Release | Apple/Google policy | Low | store rejection | Remove mobile lint blockers by syncing `mobile/package-lock.json` and resolving lint issues in Expo code path. | `cd mobile && npm run lint` is clean with no errors in tracked mobile source. | `release/evidence/qa/mobile-lint-final.txt`; `mobile/package-lock.json`; `mobile/eslint.config.js` | No |
| RCB-004 | QA | Quality Gates | Medium | crash/ANR | Create explicit map-fix and release evidence artifacts for deterministic replay. | Evidence folder contains map regression logs, build/type-check outputs, and CI command outputs for baseline and fixed state. | `release/evidence/baseline/*`; `release/evidence/map_fix/*`; `release/evidence/release/*` | No |
| RCB-005 | Security | MASVS-2 | Low | data risk | Keep analytics disabled by default unless explicit consent exists; maintain consent-based capture in `src/lib/analytics.ts`. | No analytics event emits before consent write; consent toggle still governs Mixpanel/PostHog initialization. | `src/lib/analytics.ts`; `release/evidence/security/secret-surface.txt`; `release/evidence/map_fix/nearby-page-smoke-preview.txt` | No |
| RCB-006 | Privacy | Apple App Privacy Details | Medium | legal/compliance | Document data inventory and mapping for collection/sharing retention, and point to implemented disclosures in `public/privacy.html`. | Inventory table complete for core data categories and sharing targets, including retention and security controls. | `release/PRIVACY_DATA_INVENTORY.md`; `public/privacy.html` | No |
| RCB-007 | Security | OWASP ASVS-6 | Medium | legal/compliance | Harden web CSP by removing inline-script allowance and keep script execution constrained to same-origin scripts. | `index.html` has no `unsafe-inline` in `script-src` directive. | `index.html`; `release/evidence/release/build-final.txt` | No |
| RCB-008 | UX/A11y | HIG, Material 3, WCAG 2.2 | Medium | UX trust | Preserve map/P0 accessibility semantics by keeping labeled controls and readable status text while avoiding redesign. | No new control redesigns; key elements continue exposing accessible names and action labels. | `components/NearbyView.tsx`; `release/evidence/ux_a11y/accessibility-scan.txt` | No |
| RCB-009 | Release | Supply-chain | Medium | legal/compliance | Generate CycloneDX SBOMs for web + mobile dependency sets and archive commands/results. | `release/SBOM/cyclonedx-web.json` and `release/SBOM/cyclonedx-mobile.json` exist and are index linked. | `release/SBOM/*`; `release/evidence/release/sbom-web.txt`; `release/evidence/release/sbom-mobile.txt` | No |
| RCB-010 | Release | NIST SSDF | Medium | store rejection | Publish one RC checklist (`release/RC_CHECKLIST.md`) with evidence commands and rollback steps. | Checklist includes rollback, verification, release artifact handoff. | `release/RC_CHECKLIST.md` | No |
| RCB-011 | Store | Apple/Google policy | Medium | store rejection | Collect required external store evidence in TestFlight smoke and Play pre-launch report format. RC remains medium until evidence links are attached. | TestFlight smoke matrix completed with passing artifacts; Play pre-launch report generated and reviewed. | `release/evidence/store/testflight-smoke-notes.md`; `release/evidence/store/play-prelaunch-report.md` | No |
